Array - I would use an ArrayList implementation only if the key for the element was its id, which it would get when inserted into the table and be equal to the length of the ArrayList, and elements would be accessed by the element's id. In all other cases, it seems more advantageous to use a dictionary implementation - HashMap, since search, deletion, and inserting would be performed in O(1), whereas all these operations in an ArrayList are on average performed in O(n).
